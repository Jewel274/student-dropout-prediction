# student-dropout-prediction
Machine Learning project predicting student academic success and dropout using MATLAB. 

# Objective
The aim of this project was to apply machine learning techniques using MATLAB to perform both classification and regression tasks on datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project utilized MATLAB's Classification Learner and Regression Learner apps to build, train, evaluate, and export machine learning models for predictive tasks.

# Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Classification Learner App
- Regression Learner App

# Datasets & Tasks

# Part 1: Classification
- Dataset: Student Dropout and Academic Success Dataset (UCI Repository)
- Steps Taken:
  - Imported dataset into MATLAB and preprocessed (handled missing values, encoding, and scaling)
  - Used Classification Learner to train 30+ models including SVMs, Trees, KNNs, Neural Networks, and Ensemble Models
  - Evaluated models using cross-validation, confusion matrix, accuracy, and cost metrics
  - Exported the best-performing model (Boosted Trees) for further analysis

- Best Models:
  - **Training**: Linear SVM (76.9% Accuracy)
  - **Testing**: Boosted Trees (74.9% Accuracy, Lowest Error Rate)

 Part 2: Regression
- Dataset: Student Performance Dataset
- Steps Taken:
  - Imported and cleaned dataset
  - Trained various regression models including Linear Regression, Trees, SVMs, and Neural Networks
  - Evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared
  - Exported top-performing regression model

# ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation & Findings

- Bagged Trees and Boosted Trees were most cost-efficient and accurate
- Models like Logistic Regression showed poor generalization
- Overfitting was observed in models like Wide Neural Network and Fine KNN
- Best models showed minimal performance drop between training and testing

# Key Learning Outcomes

- Understood and applied core machine learning concepts in real-world contexts
- Gained practical experience with MATLABâ€™s ML tools
- Analyzed, compared, and validated multiple machine learning models
- Learned to evaluate model effectiveness and identify overfitting and generalization patterns
